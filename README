This is the README file for Bill Huston's PD Toolkit.

I use these abstractions (modules) and patches to make music and soundscapes for my video work. 
I hope you find them useful.

I am publishing this now to Github, which should make keeping things up-to-date easier. 

DISCLAIMER
==========

Everything here is provided without warranty! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
I have tried to produce high-quality code with good practices
(e.g., removes DC components). But YOU ASSUME ALL RISK of using
this, including damage to hearing, speakers, etc. 

WARNING: Some modules (like Echo-Reverb) which use regenerative feedback.
I have tried to build in some overload protections, but caution should
be used.
